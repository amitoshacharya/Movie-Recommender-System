# Movie-Recommender-System

A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. 
In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. 
Example: 
	In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, 
	In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or 
	In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.

### Use-Cases of Recommendation System

	There are many use-cases of it. Some are:

		•	Personalized Content: 
		    Helps to Improve the on-site experience by creating dynamic recommendations for different kinds of audiences like Netflix does.

		•	Better Product search experience: 
		    Helps to categories the product based on their features like Material, Season, etc.

### However, the following three categories are mostly followed:
		•	Collaborative filtering
		•	Content-based filtering
		•	Hybrid filtering

#### Content-based filtering

	•	It is metadata (or features) based recommendation like movie metadata (genres, director, cast, crew etc.)
	•	In this type of recommendation system, relevant items are shown using the content of the previously searched items by the users. 
	•	Here content refers to the attribute/tag of the product that the user like. 
	•	In this type of system, products are tagged using certain keywords, then the system tries to understand what the user wants, and it looks in its 		 database and finally tries to recommend different products that the user wants.
